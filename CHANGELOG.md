## [0.1.0](https://github.com/QuentinStoll/VstProfiler/releases/tag/0.1.0) - 2025-12-11

The release notes describe this initial release as an experimental beta (`v0.1.0-beta`); its actual Git tag is `0.1.0`.

### Added

- Initial JUCE-based VST3 prototype targeting Windows.
- Sweep generation and output from the plugin, with manual capture through an external DAW.
- Impulse-response loading in the real-time audio path.
- Early LUT-based amp simulation and loading of paired DI/amplifier audio files.
- Initial cloning, selection, and playing screens, with rotary controls connected to processing.
- Projucer/Visual Studio project files and platform setup scripts.
- Published `Profiler.vst3` and raw/processed guitar and sweep WAV examples.

### Known limitations at release

- Sweep capture required an external DAW; automatic capture was not implemented.
- Amp processing and sound quality were preliminary. Complete automatic profiling and dynamic amp-behavior modeling remained future work.

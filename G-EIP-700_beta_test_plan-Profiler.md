## **1. Project context**
**VSTProfiler** is an open-source software project dedicated to the digital cloning of hardware amplifiers. Developed using the **JUCE framework**, that can operates as both a standalone application and a plugin (VST3/AU). The project focuses on high-fidelity sonic reproduction, **ultra-low latency** performance, and a robust architecture designed for community contribution. It integrates a professional workflow including multi-platform CI/CD (Windows, macOS, Linux), real-time performance metrics, and comprehensive technical documentation.

## **2. User Roles**
The following roles are involved in the beta testing phase.

| **Role Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **End User** | Musicians or producers using the plugin for real-time audio processing without perceptible delay. |
| **Contributor** | External developers seeking to understand the architecture, submit bug fixes, or improve the DSP engine. |
| **QA Engineer** | Internal team members responsible for validating metrics (CPU/Latency), unit tests, and CI/CD pipeline health. |

# Roadmap: Open-Source Excellence & Native Performance (Year 2)

## High-Level Strategy:
- **Q1: Bulletproof Signal & Performance Profiling** – Eliminate hardware capture noise, optimize SIMD vectorization, and benchmark CPU overhead.
- **Q2: No-Code Local Training Pipeline** – Completely replace Google Colab with a local, one-click desktop/terminal training environment.
- **Q3: Ecosystem Interoperability** – Open your loader to existing open-source model formats (e.g., converting or loading `.nam` files) to gain instant catalog scale.
- **Q4: Release, Packaging & Community Launch** – Build professional installers, polish documentation, and release to the global open-source audio developer and guitar communities.

## 52-WEEK DETAILED ROADMAP

### Phase 1 - Technical Foundation & Performance Profiling (Weeks 1-13)
* **Weeks 1-3: Hardware Capture Standardization**
  * Design a rigorous physical routing protocol to address ground loop issues (Reamping, isolation, impedance matching).
  * Update the repository's `README.md` with clear, visual connection diagrams for hardware profiling (e.g., Marshall AVT loop).
* **Weeks 4-6: Automated Pre-Process Diagnostics**
  * Implement automated signal analysis in Python to detect phase misalignment, clipping, or high ground-loop noise before starting the training process.
  * Optimize `FORCE_ALIGN` parameters to auto-correct micro-latency offsets down to sub-sample accuracy.
* **Weeks 7-9: Real-time SIMD Optimization (JUCE/C++)**
  * Integrate SIMD vectorization frameworks (e.g., `xsimd` or Eigen vectorization flags) within your RTNeural implementation.
  * Force 32-bit `float` precision calculations throughout the audio thread, bypassing expensive double-to-float conversions.
* **Weeks 10-13: Comparative Benchmarking (VstProfiler)**
  * Use your `VstProfiler` tool to run comparative CPU load tests of your plugin against industry standards (e.g., NAM, ChowTape) under various buffer sizes (32 to 512 samples).
  * Publish performance/latency benchmark graphs on GitHub to establish technical credibility.

### Phase 2 - Local No-Code Training Pipeline (Weeks 14-26)
* **Weeks 14-17: Local Training Script Packaging**
  * Containerize the training pipeline (Docker) or bundle PyTorch/RecNet into a standalone local Python environment (using virtualenvs/conda packagers).
  * Optimize training for consumer hardware (utilizing Apple Silicon MPS acceleration and local CUDA GPUs).
* **Weeks 18-21: GUI Compagnon for Training**
  * Develop a lightweight desktop frontend (or an extension of your standalone application) where users can drag-and-drop their `input.wav` and `target.wav` files.
  * Eliminate terminal commands completely for the training step.
* **Weeks 22-24: One-Click Local Export**
  * Automate the post-training export pipeline to automatically move the generated `model.json` to the plugin’s native user preset directory.
* **Weeks 25-26: Early Stopping & Loss Tweaking**
  * Adjust early stopping mechanics and introduce spectral/pre-emphasis loss functions in the local training pipeline to drive ESR under 0.02 on high-gain profiles.

### Phase 3 - Interoperability & Open Ecosystem (Weeks 27-39)
* **Weeks 27-30: Format Research & Converter Prototype**
  * Analyze format schemas of dominant open-source profiling tools (such as Neural Amp Modeler `.nam` files or WaveNet-based JSON outputs).
  * Write a converter script to translate external weights into your optimized RTNeural format.
* **Weeks 31-34: Direct Loader Integration**
  * Implement multi-format loading capabilities directly inside the JUCE plugin loader class.
  * Allow users to drag-and-drop both your proprietary files and standard external profile files directly into the GUI.
* **Weeks 35-37: Cab Sim & IR Optimization**
  * Refactor your Impulse Response (IR) convolution engine in JUCE using zero-latency partitioned convolution to handle heavy CAB profiles without CPU spikes.
* **Weeks 38-39: Metadata & Asset Tagging**
  * Implement standard JSON metadata parsing (Author, Amp Type, Gain Stage, Date) inside the plugin's model browser.

### Phase 4 - Production Release & Community Scaling (Weeks 40-52)
* **Weeks 40-43: Zero-Allocation Bug Hunt**
  * Perform deep static analysis of the JUCE audio thread. Ensure absolutely no memory allocations (`new`/`malloc`), system calls, or lock acquisitions occur during processing to prevent audio dropouts.
* **Weeks 44-46: CI/CD & Cross-Platform Packaging**
  * Set up GitHub Actions to automatically build, test, and package your plugin.
  * Generate signed installers for Windows (`.exe`) and macOS (Universal Binary `.pkg` supporting Intel and Apple Silicon), along with native Linux builds.
* **Weeks 47-49: Ultimate Documentation & Asset Polish**
  * Revamp the entire GitHub repository: clean code comments, detailed setup guides, code architecture explanations, and a visual showcase (with interactive audio examples hosted on GitHub Pages).
* **Weeks 50-52: Public Launch & Developer Outreach**
  * Present the project to major audio developer platforms (KVR Audio, JUCE forums, Discord server groups, and target subreddits).
  * Deliver the technical presentation highlighting performance metrics, comparative profiling results, and the zero-latency implementation.

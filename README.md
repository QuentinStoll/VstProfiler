# VSTProfiler - Guitar Amplifier Simulator

VSTProfiler is an open-source audio plugin for guitarists who want to shape and save amplifier tones using neural amp models, cabinet impulse responses, and real-time controls, in a DAW or a standalone application.

## Why this project

**EIP 2025-2026 - Technical Track.** This final-year engineering project was started in fourth year by four students at Epitech Paris.

The goal is to give guitarists a free, customizable way to explore amplifier and cabinet sounds. Musicians can combine external models and impulse responses, adjust their tone, and reuse saved profiles. Developers and audio enthusiasts can inspect and extend the C++ processing chain and JUCE interface.

Reproducing the tone and dynamic behavior of real amplifiers is the project's longer-term ambition; the current implementation and its limits are described below.

## Features and current limitations

### Implemented features

- Load cabinet impulse responses through the **Clone** view and process audio with JUCE convolution.
- Load compatible neural amplifier models through RTNeural.
- Adjust gain, noise gate, master volume, mute, and a five-band EQ through the **Play** view.
- Create, edit, import, export, and delete `.profilerprofile` profiles containing parameter values and external asset paths.
- Use a JUCE interface with **Clone**, **Play**, **Profil**, and settings views.
- Build VST3 and standalone targets; AU is intended for macOS.

### Current limitations

- This is an experimental project. Audio quality, performance, and host compatibility still need validation for each use case.
- The **Clone** view loads existing files; it does not currently provide an amplifier capture or model-training workflow.
- Amp files must contain a model that the RTNeural JSON parser accepts, with one input and at least one output. The file chooser lists `.nam`, `.json`, and `.txt`, but an extension alone does not guarantee compatibility.
- Profiles reference external amp and IR files rather than embedding them. Keep those files available when reopening or sharing a profile.
- The processor currently requires mono input and stereo output. Configure the host's channel layout accordingly.
- Windows and Linux have CI test jobs. macOS/AU remains a target requiring build validation: the current non-Windows dependency block also requires GTK3 and WebKit2GTK.
- Preset format selections are not fully wired into the plugin target, which currently declares its formats directly in `Source/CMakeLists.txt`.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Git, CMake **3.22 or later**, and a **C++20** compiler.
- Internet access for the first configure step: CMake fetches JUCE **8.0.12**, spdlog, simdjson, RTNeural, and Tracy. See [dependency configuration](cmake/dependencies.cmake) for the selected versions.
- On Windows: Visual Studio 2022 or Build Tools with the **Desktop development with C++** workload and a Windows SDK. Run commands from a developer terminal.
- On Linux: a C++20-capable GCC or Clang toolchain and the JUCE system dependencies below.
- For live guitar input: an audio interface and a configured audio input/output device. The VST3 build also needs a compatible plugin host.

For Debian/Ubuntu, the system libraries used by the repository's CI can be installed with:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential cmake git pkg-config \
  libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxcomposite-dev \
  libfreetype6-dev libfontconfig1-dev libasound2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev \
  libssl-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev libglib2.0-dev \
  mesa-common-dev libjack-jackd2-dev libdbus-1-dev
```

### Installation

Clone the repository and enter its directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/QuentinStoll/VstProfiler.git
cd VstProfiler
```

Configure and build on Windows using `install.bat`:

```powershell
.\install.bat all default
```

Configure and build on Linux using `install.sh`:

```sh
bash ./install.sh all default
```

The scripts compile from source; they do not install the plugin into your DAW's plugin directory. This project overrides JUCE's default output directories: the standalone application is under `build/bin/Standalone/`, and the VST3 bundle is under `build/bin/lib/VST3/`. Generated JUCE support files remain under `build/Source/Profiler_artefacts/`.

### Configuration

No `.env` file or API keys are required for the documented local workflow.

Build settings live in [cmake/presets_config.json](cmake/presets_config.json). Both scripts accept an action followed by an optional preset: `default`, `release`, `all-formats`, `dev`, or `debug`. To change an existing build's preset, run the `config` action first (for example, `.\install.bat config dev` or `bash ./install.sh config dev`), then run the `build` action. Use `.\install.bat --help` or `bash ./install.sh --help` to list the available actions.

The Windows build action does not pass a CMake `--config` option. With Visual Studio, it therefore uses the generator's default build configuration, which is normally Debug, even when the preset sets a Release build type. To explicitly build Release after configuring with the script, run `cmake --build build --config Release --parallel 8`.

The application stores settings and profiles in the JUCE user application-data directory under `Profiler`, with profiles in its `Profiles` subdirectory. On Windows, this is normally `%APPDATA%\Profiler`. External amp and IR files remain at their selected paths.

### Launch

On Windows:

```powershell
& ".\build\bin\Standalone\Profiler.exe"
```

On Linux:

```sh
./build/bin/Standalone/Profiler
```

For DAW use, copy the entire `build/bin/lib/VST3/Profiler.vst3` bundle to a VST3 location scanned by your host, and rescan plugins. Load **Profiler** on a track configured for mono input and stereo output. Build configurations share these output paths, so building Debug can replace an existing Release binary.

## Usage

### Play through an amp model and cabinet IR

1. Launch the standalone application and select your audio device, or load the plugin in your DAW and route your guitar input to it.
2. Open **Clone**, choose **Load Amp**, and select a compatible RTNeural model file.
3. Choose **Load IR** to select a cabinet impulse response. The chooser lists WAV, AIFF, AIF, and FLAC files.
4. Open **Play** and adjust gain, noise gate, EQ, and master volume while monitoring your input.
5. Check the file status cards if a model or IR does not load, and verify that the selected file still exists and is compatible.

### Save and reuse a tone

Use the export controls in **Play** to save the current settings as a profile or export a `.profilerprofile` file. Open **Profil** to create, import, edit, or delete profiles, and use the profile selector in **Play** to recall one. When sharing a profile, provide its referenced assets separately and update their paths on the receiving machine.

## Architecture

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [PluginProcessor](Source/Src/PluginProcessor.cpp) | Audio processing, host parameters, model/IR loading, and plugin state. |
| [PluginEditor](Source/Src/PluginEditor.cpp), [Views](Source/Src/Views), and [Modules](Source/Src/Modules) | JUCE interface, controls, file selection, and profile workflows. |
| [ProfileManager](Source/Src/ProfileManager.cpp) | Profile validation, local JSON storage, import/export, and parameter recall. |
| [Source/Include](Source/Include) | Shared interfaces, settings paths, and styling definitions. |
| [cmake](cmake) | Dependency fetching, build presets, and compiler configuration. |
| [Tests](Tests) | Automated checks for audio processing, profiles, settings, logging, and UI components. |

Audio flows from the host or standalone audio device through gain, noise gate, and EQ processing, then the amp-model stage and cabinet convolution, before reaching the output. UI controls and recalled profiles update the processor's parameter state. Settings and profiles are stored locally; this workflow has no backend or database service.

## Tests

On Windows:

```powershell
.\install.bat test
```

On Linux:

```sh
bash ./install.sh test
```

These commands build `ProfilerTests` and run the CTest suite. Tests are enabled by default through `PROFILER_BUILD_TESTS`. The [CI workflow](.github/workflows/CI.yml) defines Windows and Linux test jobs and a Windows coverage job.
